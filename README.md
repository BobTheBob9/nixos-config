This is my current nixos config, you can install it by running `sudo nixos-rebuild --flake /path/to/repo switch` on a nixos computer, it should just work
previously this was using home-manager, but i've decided to move it to just 1 big config for simplicity, additionally i used to have an overcomplex makefile-based codegen system for enabling/disabling certain parts of the config, that's gone too, maybe someday i'll use nixos's built in options stuff for it, i dunno
